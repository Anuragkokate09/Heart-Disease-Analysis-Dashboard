🫀 Heart Disease Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)

This repository hosts the files for a comprehensive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze key clinical factors and their impact on patient survival rates related to heart disease.

The dashboard provides interactive visualizations to explore mortality metrics, risk factor distributions, and cumulative outcomes over time.

📊 Dashboard Overview

The analysis is structured around two main pages/sections, covering the key insights from the data:

1. Clinical Factors and Survival

This page focuses on core medical metrics and survival outcomes:

Survival Rate & Smoker Rate: High-level metrics for quick assessment.

Survival by Ejection Fraction (EF): Visual comparison of survival status based on Ejection Fraction bins.

Creatinine Levels and Death Count: Analysis of Serum Creatinine levels against mortality.

Cumulative Outcomes Over Time: Trends showing cumulative deaths versus cumulative survivals.

2. Impact of Risk Factors on Survival

This page investigates the influence of specific patient risk factors:

Proportion of Patients by Diabetes Status: Breakdown of diabetic vs. non-diabetic patients.

Sum of Age by Smoking Status: Analysis of age distribution across smoking statuses.

Distribution of Risk Factor Combinations: Heatmap/chart showing how different combinations of risk factors affect survival.

🛠️ Technology Used

Platform: Power BI Desktop (DAX)

Key Techniques: Data Wrangling, Feature Engineering, Custom Measures (Survival Rate, Median Ejection Fraction), Data Visualization.

Key DAX Measures: Survival Rate, Median Ejection Fraction, Smoker Rate.

Data Source: (Specify your data source, e.g., Clinical Records CSV)
