🫀 Heart Disease Analysis Dashboard – Power BI

📌 Overview

The Heart Disease Analysis Dashboard provides a comprehensive and interactive view of clinical data to analyze patient survival outcomes. It focuses on identifying how key clinical factors (like Ejection Fraction and Serum Creatinine) and demographic risk factors influence mortality rates. This dashboard is crucial for quickly pinpointing high-risk patient segments.

📈 Insights Delivered

The analysis is structured around two main pages:

🏥 Clinical Factors and Survival

Key Metrics: Survival Rate, Total Survivors, Total Deaths, and Average Age of Survival.

Clinical Visuals: Distribution of survival status across Ejection Fraction (EF) and Serum Creatinine levels.

Trend Analysis: Cumulative survival vs. cumulative deaths over the observation period.

🧪 Impact of Risk Factors on Survival

Risk Factor Breakdown: Analysis of patient proportions by Diabetes and the effect of Smoking Status on age distribution.

Survival Correlation: Heatmap analysis showing the interaction of combined risk factors (Smoking, High Blood Pressure, Anaemia) on final survival outcomes.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Tool: Power BI Desktop (DAX) 📊 – For dashboard design and custom measure creation.

Data Transformation: Power Query – Used for initial data cleaning and shaping.

Measures: DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Utilized to calculate Survival Rate, Median EF, and other custom KPIs.
